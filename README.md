# FIB-VC

This repository contains the different lab sessions developed in MATLAB, as well as the two projects for the bachelor's degree subject Computer Vision.

The first project consisted of the prediction of the football team from images without using machine learning algorithms, just Computer Vision algorithms and the colours of the shirts.

The second project consisted in extract different characteristics from the MNIST dataset images using Computer Vision algorithms and then using these characteristics to predict the number with different machine learning algorithms (without convolutional neural networks or similar).
